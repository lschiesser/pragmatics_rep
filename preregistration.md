# Background

The theoretical background of our experiment is the assumption that politeness violates basic communicative maxims of quality, yet it is an omnipresent phenomenon in human communication. The authors of the original paper hypothesize that polite utterances result from a trade-off between informativity and social values. The original study was used to create and validate a model, which predicts how communicative goals influence people's perception of utterances evaluating a performance.
<br>
We chose this study, because we are interested in cross-linguistic comparisons and studies. Also our results will serve as a basis study to state the influence of the politeness markers "du" and "Sie" in German on the inferences. Because in German there are these politeness markers, like "Sie" our intuition is the interpretation will differ depending on the use of "du" versus "Sie".
<br>
Our research question is therefore this baseline study, which will investigate the influence of the communicative goal on the interpretation of utterances without the influence of "du" and "Sie". The question we will investigate is, if we will get the same results as in the original study, if we completely avoid the use of "du" and "Sie".

# Research questions

This study is a replication of the second Experiment from the paper "Talking with tact: Polite language as a balance between kindness and informativity" by Yoon et al. (2016). In this experiment the participants are asked to infer the state of mind of the speaker in a fictional scenario presented to them. We now want to find out, if the inferred states similar in German and in English?
<br>
<br>
Our hypotheses are the following the following two.
<br>
Hypothesis 1 is concerned with the positive utterances and predicts that on the one hand the mean of the goal "nett" will be greater than the mean of the goal "ehrlich". On the other hand it predicts that the mean of the goal "nett" will be greater than the mean of the goal "gemein".
<br>
Hypothesis 2 is concerned with the negative utterances and predicts first, that the mean of the goal "gemein" will be greater than the mean of the goal "ehrlich". Secondly, this hypothesis predicts that the mean of the goal "ehrlich" will be the same as the mean of the goal "nett".
<br>
1. Hypothesis 1: positive utterances:
    - mean(nice_inferred) < mean (honest_inferred)
    - mean(nice_inferred) > mean(mean_inferred)
2. Hypothesis 2: negative utterances:
    - mean(mean_inferred) > mean(honest_inferred)
    - mean(honest_inferred) = mean(nice_inferred)

# Design of the Experiment

## General remarks about the design
This is a rating study with a between subject 3x5 factorial design. The design matrix composes of three goals (nett, ehrlich, gemein) and five utterances (furchtbar, schlecht, okay, gut, hervorragend).

## Sampling plan

We would like to recruit around 30 participants, around the same number the used in the original study. The link to the experiment will be send to all course participants and if necessary to all cognitive science students via the cogsci mailing list. We hope to be ready to send out the link by the end of June, after our preregistration report has been approved.
<br>
As we want to investigate, if the results will be the same in German we will need to exclude all participants who are not German native speakers. Otherwise we do not have any restrictions on who can participate.

## Materials

Out study is based on the paper **Yoon, E. J., Tessler, M. H., Goodman, N. D., & Frank, M. C. (2016). Talking with tact: Polite language as a balance between kindness and informativity. In _Proceedings of the 38th annual conference of the cognitive science society_ (pp. 2771-2776). Cognitive Science Society.**. We also used a star rating plugin, which is available under https://www.jqueryscript.net/other/Simple-jQuery-Star-Rating-System-For-Bootstrap-3.html. And of course we used the material provided by the authors of the original paper: langcog.stanford.edu/expts/EJY/polgrice/L2_S/polgrice_L2_S.html. The sentences were translated and adapted into German by ourselves.

## Procedure

### Instruction
The participants are presented with written instructions on how the experiment will look like and what their task will be. Here they also state, that their participation is voluntary and they are informed how we will process the data.
<br>
The instruction text is the following:
<br>
<br>
_**Willkommen**

<br>
_**Experimentbeschreibung**
<br>
In diesem Experiment werden Ihnen verschiedene hypothetische Szenarien/Gespräche zwischen zwei Personen beschrieben. Ihre Aufgabe wird es sein die Aussagen der Gesprächspartner zu bewerten. In den Szenarien wird beschrieben was die Personen gemacht oder gesagt haben und eine mögliche Interpretation dieses Gesprächs wird Ihnen angeboten. Sie werden gebeten, die Interpretationen zu evaluieren. Dabei befindet sich auf der Bewertungsskala bei 1 die schlechteste, bei 5 die beste Bewertung.

### Main test phase

The trials start with the presentation of the scenario and underneath the participant sees the rating scale consisting of 5 hearts. Participants are asked to rate a total of 15 scenarios using the heart rating scale. The scenarios, the goals, the names and the utterances are randomized.

### Structure of the Experiment
The experiment starts with a welcome text, followed by instructions. Then the main test phase starts and in the end participants are asked a few questions like their age, gender and they have the chance to give us feedback or leave comments.
<br>
We decided not to include practive trials, because it was not part of the original study and we still wanted to replicate it as closely as possible.

### Trials
We only have the main trials, which are a rating task. The results of these main trials will then be used for our analysis.
<br>
We decided not to include practice trials, because it was not part of the original study and we still wanted to replicate it as closely as possible.
<br>
The trials are structured in the way that participants are presented with a randomized scenario and the heart rating scale (one to five hearts). The participants then answer the question using the five-heart rating scale.

## Measured variables

The variables we will measure are inferred state and the rating of the performance which will be measured by the rating scale. Further we will note the utterance and the goal of each trial.
<br>
<br>
The goal will be treated as a factor, the utterance as an ordered factor (monotonic predictor) and the rating/inferred state as an int, such that the mean can be calculated.

# Analysis Plan

## Exclusion criteria

In the analysis for single trial data we will exclude all trials, in which the participants took longer than 2 minutes to answer the question.
<br>
From a whole participant we will exclude all non native German speakers.

## Confirmatory hypothesis testing

The utterances will be transformed into an ordered factor using mo().
<br>
For the statistical model we will use the "brms" package to run a Bayesian regression model, regressing the inferred state against goal, utterance and their interactions. We will also try  a model with random by-domain effects and compare the fit. Further we will consider the differences within the intervals between the utterance.
<br>
<br>
For positive utterances, i.e. if hypothesis 1 is true, we expect the inferred state for honest utterances to be credibly higher that the inferred state for nice utterances in the posterior distribution.
<br>
If H1 is true, we expect the inferred state for nice utterances to be credibly higher than the inferred state for mean utterances in the posterior distribution.
<br>
<br>
For negative utterances, i.e. if hypothesis 2 is true, we expect the inferred state for mean utterances to be credibly higher than the inferred state for honest utterances in the posterior distribution.
<br>
If H2 is true, we expect with a credible probability that the inferred state for honest and mean utterances to be equal in the posterior distribution.
