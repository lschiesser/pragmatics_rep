\section{Introduction}


\section{Methods}
Our experiment measured what participants inferred about a true state of the world given an utterance (e.g. "Der Kuchen war okay." \textit{The cake was okay.}) and an intention of the speaker in our fictional scenarios. \\
\textbf{Participants} For the experiment we recruited \textbf{(insert number)} participants by sending the link to all students subscribed to the cognitive science mailing list. In our email we asked only German native speakers to participate in the experiment.\\
\textbf{Stimuli and Design} Because we wanted to replicate this experiment in German we translated the 13 scenarios presented in the original study and made sure to avoid the use of the words "du" and "Sie" (\textit{you} in English) as they are marker for politeness in the German language. The scenarios were all constructed in the same manner. One person performed an action (e.g. baked a cake) and asked another person for their opinion about it. The other person responded using different utterances to rate the performance (it was "furchtbar, schlecht, okay, gut oder hervorragend", \textit{terrible, bad, okay, good, or amazing}) and they had different intentions (or goals: being "gemein, ehrlich oder nett", \textit{mean, honest, or nice}). The names of the persons, utterances and intentions were randomized, but it was controlled that every participant rated each of the 15 (five utterances and three intentions) possible combinations.\\
\textbf{Procedure} The participants read the scenarios (e.g. "Laura hat einen Kuchen gebacken und fragt Hannah wie sie ihn findet.", \textit{Laura baked a cake and asks Hannah about it.}). Then the participants were also shown the speaker's utterance and intention, e.g. "Hannah wollte ehrlich sein und sagt: "Der Kuchen ist gut.", \textif{Hannah wanted to be honest and said: "The cake was good."}.
