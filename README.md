tbd | Statistical analysis

## Details for Plan
- Hypothesis formulation and structure of Experiment
  - Two experiments or two parts of one?
  - Stimuli prep
- experiments
  - experiment 1: one to one translation and Replication
  - experiment 2:
- Statistical Analysis
  - two analyses for exp1 and exp2 separately
## General Questions to answer during familiarization
- Which scale would be best to replicate for second experiment? (hearts, numbers, starts, ...)

## Question for Franke
- experiments in one or separate?
- Netlify from folder?
- Scale?
- adjustment of names ?

## Design
- General conditions
  - 5 states (1-5 hearts), uniform prior distribution
  - utterances {terrible, bad, ok, good, amazing}
  - 3 goals: honest, nice, mean
- Exp 1: literal semantics measurement 
  - 30 participants, 13 randomized context items, 25 scenarios (5 states x 5 utterances), Yes/No answers
  - analysis across contexts
  - fraction of participants choosing utterance w for state s = literal meaning function value
- Exp 2: measurement of listener's inference about state given utterance and goal 
  - 35 participants, context items with question about performance, 15 randomized items / participant (3 goals x 5 states), rating task on heart scale 
  - hypothesis 1: utterance consistent with goal: 1) mean(nice_inferred) < mean (honest_inferred) 2) mean(mean_inferred) > mean(honest_inferred) 3) mean(mean_inferred) > mean(nice_inferred)
  - hypothesis 2: utterance inconsistent with goal: only for mean? (intuition) ; post hoc hypotheses
